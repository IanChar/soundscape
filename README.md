Soundscape
==========

Soundscape is a site where users can share and discover original music based on location. Users who upload songs via a Soundcloud link will see their contribution added to a local playlist. To discover new music, simply click on a location marker on the global map, which will bring up a playlist containing all songs uploaded by artists in that area. Then click on a song and a Soundcloud widget will pop up and play it!
